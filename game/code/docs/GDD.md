# Game Design Document: Love Potions Online

# 1. Core Vision & Concept

## 1.1 High Concept
A narrative-driven mystery game where players use narrative choices to unravel a magical conspiracy and save their best friend from a controlling relationship.

## 1.2 Project Vision
To create an emotionally resonant mystery that blends cozy fantasy with modern technology. The game will empower players through investigation and dialogue, exploring themes of consent, friendship, and the responsible use of power. The core experience is centered on being a clever investigator, a loyal friend, and discovering a hidden magical world.

## 1.2 Key Themes
Consent, free will, authenticity vs. artificiality, memory, friendship, the nature of love, and the responsible use of power.

## 1.4 Target Audience
Players of narrative-driven games and visual novels.
Fans of the "cozy fantasy" and "urban fantasy" genres.
Players who enjoy mystery and investigation gameplay loops.
Audiences looking for stories with strong character development and diverse representation, including asexual and aromantic characters.

# 2. Gameplay & Mechanics

## 2.1 Gameplay Pillars
Narrative-Driven Choice: Gameplay is centered exclusively on making choices within the narrative. All mechanical systems are designed to serve the story and enhance player immersion.
Character-Centric Progression: Story progression is measured by the unfolding narrative and the development of interpersonal relationships, not by overcoming skill-based challenges.

## 2.2 Core Interaction Model
Branching Dialogue: The primary gameplay mechanic is a branching dialogue system. Players select from a set of choices that directs the conversation and the flow of the scene.
Consequential Decisions: Choices have a direct impact on three areas: advancing the plot by uncovering clues, defining the protagonist's personality, and influencing relationships with other characters.

## 2.3 Core Systems
Relationship System: A points-based system that tracks the protagonist's standing with key characters, particularly the romance options, Ash and Ignatius. Relationship scores are influenced by specific dialogue choices, such as the initial decision on how to address Ignatius ("Nate" or "Ignatius") .
Personality Flavor System: This system allows for deep protagonist role-playing without restricting player freedom.
Function: Choices are flagged with personality traits (e.g., Assertive/Shy, Pragmatic/Idealistic) that flavor the protagonist's dialogue and internal monologue .
Design Principle: This system is purely for expressive flavor. It will not gatekeep any narrative paths, choices, or endings.

## 2.4 Design Philosophy - Simplicity and Focus
The exclusion of mechanics like mini-games or inventory is a deliberate design choice to ensure the player experience remains focused entirely on the characters, the mystery, and the emotional weight of the narrative.'

## 3. Characters & Customization

## 3.1 Protagonist Definition & Customization
Identity: The protagonist is a woman.
Sexuality: Her sexuality is defined through player action, with options to pursue romantic relationships with the two male leads or not.
Player-Defined Name: The protagonist's first and last name can be set by the player.
Job: The player can choose a remote job (Entertainment, Research, Finance, or Freelance), which may provide unique dialogue options.

## 3.2 Key Characters
Ignatius "Nate" Thornwick (The Alchemist): A reclusive, socially awkward, and brilliant alchemist who is aromantic/asexual. He is horrified that his harmless "novelty" potions are being perverted into dangerous spells . He adores his familiar, Princess Pinkpaws.
Ashketharon "Ash" Zephyrius Voidrender the Eternal (The Dragon): An ancient, pansexual dragon in human form who acts as the power source for Ignatius's alchemy. His "hoard" is a vast collection of digital assets in the MMO
Nephilim.
Roan Song (The Victim): The protagonist's best friend, a trendy Korean-American man whose personality has been completely overwritten by a love potion .
Heather Rose Cromwell (The Antagonist): Roan's wealthy, clever, and privileged girlfriend who uses her resources to control Roan, whom she sees as a possession .
Obsidian Foxglove (The Hidden Antagonist): A social media scammer with weak magical talent who enhances Ignatius's potions and sells them through the app "Glamour" .
Princess Pinkpaws (The Familiar): Ignatius's highly intelligent poodle-mix service animal. She can speak, and is surprised to learn the protagonist can understand her, as this is highly unusual for someone without magical training. This ability is a direct result of the protagonist's recent, sudden exposure to powerful magic.

## 4. Setting

## 4.1 World-Building
Technology & Magic: The mundane and magical worlds intersect through technology like the MMO Nephilim and the video-sharing app Glamour .

## 4.2 Magic System
The Core Rule: Magic is real but hidden from the general public and highly regulated by a secret society to prevent mass hysteria.
The Cost of Magic: All magic requires a payment of life force. This is typically sourced from ingredients (like the "death" of plants), but can be drawn from living beings. Ash, being immortal, provides an infinite source for Ignatius.
Natural Disruption: Salt acts as a magic-disrupting agent, which is why Ignatius uses it to weaken his potions and why Heather enforces a "no-sodium" diet on Roan .
Potions:
Nate's Novelty Potions: Weak, last only an hour or two, and have harmless effects (e.g., changing one's sense of taste).
Enhanced Potions: The dangerous versions sold by Obsidian last for 3-5 weeks.

## 5. Art Direction

## 5.1 Overall Aesthetic & Mood
Core Concept: Cozy Modern Fantasy. The visual style should feel grounded in our world but with a touch of gothic, magical elegance.
Mood: The mood should shift from tense and mysterious during investigations to warm and inviting during character-driven moments at the manor. Lighting is key, with soft, warm interior lights contrasted by dramatic shadows and the ethereal glow of magical elements.

- **Dodger Blue**: `#4d9fff`

### Primary Design Scheme
- **Primary Game Color**: Dusty Rose
- **Accent Colors**: Wisteria, Ash Grey, and Dodger Blue

### Usage Notes
These colors should be used consistently throughout the game's user interface elements, including:
- Buttons and interactive elements

## 5.3 Environment Design:
The Manor: A "spooky" but well-kept gothic revival or Queen Anne style house. The interior features a "mystery novel" living room and a posh, rose-and-gold guest room, alongside areas showing their age with faded wallpaper.
Digital Environments: The Glamour app should have a sleek, trendy UI, while the Nephilim MMO should have a high-fantasy aesthetic.

## 5.4 Character Design:
Morgan (Protagonist): Relatable and practical, serving as a canvas for the player.
Ignatius: He dresses for comfort and isolation, primarily wearing a simple black hoodie. The hoodie is oversized and serves as a sort of "modern-day wizard robe," reflecting both his magical nature and his reclusive, work-from-home lifestyle.
Ash: Modern and casual, known for his signature tropical shirts, which contrast with his ancient nature. His posture is relaxed and open.
Princess Pinkpaws: An elegant, tall poodle mix defined by the string of pearls she wears instead of a collar.

## 5.5 UI/UX Design:
Readability: The UI must prioritize clean, readable text, adhering to the specified color palette for text boxes and fonts.
Intuitive Interaction: Choices should be presented clearly. Personality-flavored choices could have small, intuitive icons next to them to aid player understanding.
Immersion: The game requires custom UI screens that mimic in-game apps (Glamour) to enhance player immersion.

## 6. Technical Direction

## 6.1 Engine & Scripting:
The game is built on a visual novel engine capable of handling complex branching narratives.
Scripting Language: Must robustly support variable tracking, conditional logic (if/else statements), and custom macros to streamline development.
File Organization: Using a modular structure. Scripts must be separated into folders for chapters, character routes, and common/shared scenes to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance.

## 6.2 Core Systems Implementation:
Variable Management: The backend must handle numerical variables for the Relationship System and flag-based variables for the Personality Flavor System.
Player Customization: The system must allow the player to input a custom first ([mcn]) and last ([mcl]) name at the start of the game and then correctly parse and display these string variables throughout the entire script.
Conditional Text: The scripting system will heavily use conditional text tags (e.g., {assertive}Assertive response{/assertive}{shy}Shy response{/shy}) to implement the Personality Flavor System.

## 6.3 User Interface (UI) Implementation:
The engine must support the display of custom screens and menus for the in-game apps (Glamour, Nephilim).
The UI must be capable of dynamically displaying character sprites with different expressions (e.g.,
 show ash happy, show ignatius angry) and handling screen transitions (e.g., with dissolve, with fade) as specified in the script.

## 6.4 Accessibility:
Consider implementing features such as adjustable text size, font choices (including a dyslexia-friendly option), and adjustable timing for any animated text effects to ensure a broad audience can enjoy the game.

## 7. Narrative Structure

## Part 1: Common Route (The Investigation)
Objective: To introduce the setting, the primary characters, and the central conflict. Player choices during this phase will influence narrative flavor but will not determine the subsequent route.

### Scene 1: An Unsettling Invitation
The story begins with Morgan Casey, who has been invited to a remote manor by Ash, an online friend from the MMO Nephilim. Ash has made the wild claim that Morgan's best friend, Roan Song, is under the influence of a magical love potion.
Morgan is deeply skeptical but also worried. She has noticed drastic changes in Roan ever since he started dating his wealthy girlfriend, Heather Rose Cromwell. Roan has become distant, abandoned their shared hobbies, and his social media presence has shifted to "bruised purple prose." Morgan's own investigation uncovered suspicious details, such as weekly deliveries to Heather from a sketchy online shop and Roan's sudden, obsessive "no-salt" diet.
Deciding to follow the lead, Morgan drives to the "spooky murder mansion." After a moment of hesitation, she knocks and is greeted by Ash, who is far more attractive than she anticipated. He invites her in, and she is introduced to his roommate, the "man with the manor," Ignatius Thornwick, who is immediately exasperated by Ash calling him "Nate." The player must then make their first major choice: how to address the reclusive alchemist, which affects their relationships with both men.

### Scene 2: A Magical Revelation
After some cryptic conversation over pizza, the group moves to the living room where Ash reveals the core of the problem: he believes the magic controlling Roan originates from their own supply, making them partly responsible. This revelation, combined with the "cyber-stalker" implications of how much Ash knows about Roan, causes Morgan to panic and bolt for the door, only to find it locked.
Ash calms her down and offers her a room for the night. After she settles in, she is greeted by Princess Pinkpaws, Ignatius's talking poodle familiar. Due to the magical exposure, Morgan can now understand her. Princess provides emotional support and reveals more about the magical world, including the existence of magical laws and a secret society.
The next morning, Princess brings Morgan breakfast made by Ignatius. Their conversation delves deeper into the nature of potions, the difference between Ignatius's harmless "novelty" potions and the potent ones affecting Roan, and the illegality of such invasive magic. The chapter ends with Morgan beginning to understand the true scale of the situation she has walked into.

### Scene 3: The Digital Trail

### Scene 4: The Sting Operation
The Central Tension: The Ticking Clock
Following the analysis of Obsidian's potion in Scene 4, Ignatius discovers that the magic is not merely coercive but also corrosive. It actively erodes the subject's original personality and memories. Based on its potency and the duration of Roan's exposure, Ignatius calculates that they have approximately one month before Roan's original consciousness is permanently erased. This deadline serves as the primary motivator for the remainder of the plot, forcing the team into immediate and decisive action.
Part 2: The Route-Defining Choice
Objective: To present the player with a significant choice that will determine the narrative path for the remainder of the game.
Scene 5: A Fork in the Road
Driven by the urgency of the one-month deadline, the team convenes to plan their initial rescue attempt for Roan. The luxury of time is gone.
Ignatius's Proposal: A methodical, cautious, and scientifically precise strategy.
Ash's Proposal: A daring, high-risk social gambit.
Player Decision: The player is presented with a menu choice to select which plan to adopt. This decision locks in the character route for the rest of the game.
Route A: The Alchemist's Precision (Ignatius's Route)
(This route is triggered by selecting Ignatius's plan.)
Scene 6A: The Sanctuary & Sabotage
The Plan: The team lures Roan to the manor under a non-magical pretext. Ignatius prepares a magically "clean room," secured with traditional wards on all physical entry points.
The Attempt (The Hope Spot): The "salt therapy" begins. The process is gradual, allowing for a significant interaction with the real Roan.
Stage 1: Confusion. The "purple prose" filter drops. Roan is disoriented, asking simple questions ("Where am I?") and showing sensory confusion.
Stage 2: Recognition. He begins to recall specific details, using old nicknames for Morgan and referencing inside jokes. The player has a genuine, heartfelt conversation with the friend they have been missing.
Stage 3: Vulnerability. As he becomes more lucid, he realizes he has significant gaps in his memory, leading to a moment of genuine fear and confusion about his lost time.
The Sabotage: This moment of vulnerability is when the attack occurs. A panicked Heather contacts Obsidian, who dispatches Glitch. The familiar uses the reflective screen of Roan's phone to bypass Ignatius's wards. It projects a field of magical confusion, preying on Roan's disorientation.
The Failure: The progress is instantly reversed. A terrified Roan flees the manor and returns to Heather, whose control is now stronger than ever. The failure is a devastating intellectual and emotional blow to Ignatius, reinforcing his past trauma.

Scene 8A: The Liberation
Route B: The Dragon's Gambit (Ash's Route)
(This route is triggered by selecting Ash's plan.)

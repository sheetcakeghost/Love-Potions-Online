Overview
This screen language add-on will let you specify an area which will receive an ATL transform when its contents are too large to fit inside it, and will crop its contents to be only as large as the area. Especially useful for accessibility and translation to ensure contents never exceed their designated area but remain readable even with longer text or a larger font size.

Description
You can use the marquee screen element to solve several use cases:

Ensure titles and descriptions remain readable across different languages and at large text sizes by putting them in a marquee which will animate to display all contents
Include looping "ticker tape"-like text or images
Specify a rectangular area for content such as credits to scroll in rather than the whole screen
Instructions
Download marquee.zip and unzip it to get 01_marquee.rpy and marquee_examples.rpy. Drop these files into your project's game/ folder. Several examples are provided in marquee_examples.rpy, which you can try out by jumping to the label test_marquee_label.

Compatibility
This tool has been tested for compatibility with Ren'Py 7.5-7.6 and 8.0-8.2, and is expected to be compatible with earlier Ren'Py versions but has not been tested. Leave a message in the stickied thread if you run into any bugs.

Final Notes
If you'd like an easy place to use this, I recommend my Music Room code! You can use a marquee for the song title to ensure the text doesn't expand past the usable area.



I also have a variety of tutorials on my website, feniksdev.com.

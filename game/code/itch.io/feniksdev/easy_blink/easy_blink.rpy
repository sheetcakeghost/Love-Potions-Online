## Easy Blinking for Ren'Py by Feniks (feniksdev.itch.io / feniksdev.com) v1.1
##
################################################################################
## This file contains code for a special DynamicDisplayable subclass called
## EasyBlink. It makes it simple to declare blinking images for characters.
## You can find detailed write-ups on the properties + examples on my website:
## https://feniksdev.com/docs-category/easy-blinking/
##
## If you'd like to see how to use this tool, check the other file,
## easy_blink_examples.rpy! This is just the backend; you don't need to
## understand everything in this file. However, you can look at the blink_config
## constants declared immediately below; these are the default values for the
## EasyBlink class. You can change these to suit how you typically set up your
## blinking sprites.
##
## If you use this code in your projects, credit me as Feniks @ feniksdev.com

## Leave a comment on the tool page on itch.io if you run into any issues.

init -250 python in blink_config:
    _constant = True
    ## DEFAULT KWARGS. You can also supply any of these arguments
    ## to EasyBlink to change them on an individual basis.
    ## Modify the values here to what you will use most often so you don't
    ## have to specify it each time.

    ## The length of time between each blink frame.
    ## You can do 1.0/60.0 if you want this to be 60fps, for example.
    ## This can also be a list of times, which should be the same
    ## length as the number of frames your blink animation has.
    ## e.g. blink_framerate = 0.04
    ## e.g. blink_framerate = [0.04, 0.02, 0.02, 0.04]
    blink_framerate = 0.04
    ## How many seconds to wait before blinking again, in the format:
    ## (min time, max time)
    blink_repeat = (1.8, 4.5)
    ## How often the character should blink twice in quick succession.
    ## 0.1 is 10%. If this is 0.0 then the character will never blink twice
    ## in a row.
    double_blink_pct = 0.1
    ## If True, the sequence of eye images is expected to be numbered.
    ## e.g. "happy_eyes0.webp", "happy_eyes1.webp", "happy_eyes2.webp" etc.
    ## It will keep looking for images until it can't find any more.
    ## Note that the path should have a {num} substitution in it if using
    ## this.
    numbered = False
    ## If True, and numbered=True, then the first image in a numbered
    ## sequence will *not* have any number in it i.e. it will go:
    ## "happy_eyes.webp", "happy_eyes1.webp", "happy_eyes2.webp" etc.
    start_no_num = False
    ## The naming convention of additional eye images. Used only if
    ## numbered=False. So, if this was ["half_closed", "closed"] then a
    ## path of "eileen/{img}_eyes.webp" and an img of "happy" would look for:
    ##      "eileen/happy_eyes.webp", "eileen/half_closed_eyes.webp",
    ##      "eileen/closed_eyes.webp"
    ## If the path doesn't have an {img} substitution, then these should be
    ## direct image paths like ["eileen/half_closed_eyes.webp",
    ##      "eileen/closed_eyes.webp"]
    mid_eye_frames = ["closed"]
    ## If not empty, this is a list of yzoom numbers to use for automatically
    ## generated blink frames. This works by squishing the open eye frame.
    ## For this to work, the image should have all transparency below the eyes
    ## trimmed away, so that the bottom of the eye illustration is at the bottom
    ## of the image. This image will be squished down starting from the top, so
    ## the bottom always stays in the same place. It does not look good for all
    ## eye images. Looks best if the character is facing the viewer or close
    ## to it. e.g. automatic_blink_frames = [0.9, 0.8]
    automatic_blink_frames = []
    ## If True, the animation will play in reverse after it's done e.g.
    ## going from happy_eyes0 -> happy_eyes1 -> happy_eyes2 -> happy_eyes1
    ## -> happy_eyes0
    ## Otherwise it would go happy_eyes0 -> happy_eyes1 -> happy_eyes2 ->
    ## happy_eyes0
    reverse = False
    ## This is the frame the animation should begin on when looping. For most
    ## cases this will be 0, but if you have 3 frames of "startup" before it
    ## starts looping, then you would set this to 3. Note that if reverse=True,
    ## the non-looping frames won't be reversed (so if frames 0, 1, 2 were
    ## "startup", and frames 3, 4, 5 were the loop, then it would go 0, 1, 2,
    ## 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3 etc).
    loop_start_frame = 0
    ## This is the transition that should be used when switching between blink
    ## frames, or None if no transition should be used. It can either be a
    ## single transition, like `transition=Dissolve(0.2)`, or a list of
    ## transitions (same as blink_framerate).
    transitions = None
    ## A configuration value which determines whether the game should block
    ## eye blinking while a transition is occurring. If True, eyes will be
    ## shown in their open state only until the transition is completed.
    block_during_transition = True

## This is a persistent variable which determines whether blinking is on or off.
## You can adjust it as part of an animation or accessibility toggle.
